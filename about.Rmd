__Habitat for Humanity__

While at UCLA, I took part in the development of a 72 home community built exclusively for veterans. This housing track in Santa Clarita allows low income veterans to move into homes with built-in equity, and I have had the opportunity to construct these homes alongside the veterans themselves. In my fourth year, I sat on the executive board as Advocacy Chair. Important facets of my leadership position were spreading awareness on UCLAâ€™s campus of the fight against substandard housing, both on local and global scales, and encouraging students to get involved and help us make a difference. Executive board responsibilities include planning fundraisers, coordinating build days on site and organizing free tutoring for children of veterans living in the community.
